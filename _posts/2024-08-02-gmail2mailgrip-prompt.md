Step-by-Step Prompt for Email Categorization and Filtering
Objective: To categorize incoming emails from various domains into predefined categories and set up Gmail filters for forwarding.

Step 1: Provide Context

Begin by explaining the purpose of the categorization. For example:
"I need to categorize incoming emails from various domains into specific categories to improve organization and management in my Gmail inbox."
Step 2: List the Categories

Clearly define the categories you want to use. For example:
"The categories I want to implement are: Banking, Communication, Marketing, Retail, Services, and Education & Profession."
Step 3: Provide Email Domains and Senders

List the email domains or specific senders that you want to categorize. Include any relevant context for each sender. For example:
"Here are the email domains and senders I want to categorize:
Banking:
invoice+statements@stripe.com - Stripe, a leading financial services company.
buttondown@buttondown.email - Involved in email marketing and subscription management.
Communication:
contact@gradient.ai - Provides AI and technology communication services.
contato@espacoratimbum.com.br - Associated with a communication platform for newsletters."
Step 4: Define the Forwarding Addresses

Specify the email addresses where each category should forward the emails. For example:
"The forwarding addresses for each category are:
Banking: blue-summer-sound-lm74@in.mailgrip.io
Communication: still-dawn-smoke-32p1@in.mailgrip.io
Marketing: plump-quiet-leaf-0r83@in.mailgrip.io
Retail: long-fancy-dew-4a06@in.mailgrip.io
Services: bashful-withered-violet-7m68@in.mailgrip.io"
Step 5: Request for Filter Creation

Ask the AI Assistant to create Gmail filters based on the provided information. For example:
"Please create Gmail filters that capture emails from the specified senders and domains, categorizing them accordingly and setting up the forwarding rules as outlined."
Step 6: Review and Adjust

Request a review of the filters and ask for any necessary adjustments. For example:
"Once the filters are created, please provide a summary of each filter and its purpose. If any adjustments are needed, let me know."
Step 7: Future Use

Indicate that you may need to repeat this process in the future. For example:
"I would like to use this process again for categorizing new emails from other domains in the future. Please keep this structure in mind for future requests."
