Step-by-Step Prompt for Email Categorization and Filtering
Objective: To categorize incoming emails from various domains into predefined categories and set up Gmail filters for forwarding.

```

I need to categorize incoming emails from various domains into specific categories to improve organization and management in my Gmail inbox. The categories I want to implement are: Banking, Communication, Marketing, Retail, Services, and Education & Profession.

Here are the email domains and senders I want to categorize: <!-- placeholder -->

The forwarding addresses for each category are:

~~~
Banking: blue-summer-sound-lm74@in.mailgrip.io
Communication: still-dawn-smoke-32p1@in.mailgrip.io
Marketing: plump-quiet-leaf-0r83@in.mailgrip.io
Retail: long-fancy-dew-4a06@in.mailgrip.io
Services: bashful-withered-violet-7m68@in.mailgrip.io
~~~

Please create Gmail filters that capture emails from the specified senders and domains, categorizing them accordingly and setting up the forwarding rules as outlined. Once the filters are created, please provide a summary of each filter and its purpose. If any adjustments are needed, let me know. I would like to use this process again for categorizing new emails from other domains in the future.

```
