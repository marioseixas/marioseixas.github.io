### intro

1, 2, 3, go

### verse

Yeah, your carwash

And your airplanes, and the highways

We've been here for too long, for too long

Am I anxious

Or just martyred? All this darkness

Been going on too long, for too long

Yeah, yeah, yeah

### chorus

All this time, I thought you were a leader

It turns out you only a deleter

Tell your friends that you're okay

You're never gonna see them anyway

All this time, I thought you were a leader

It turns out you're only a deleter

No, no, no, no

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na no

No, no

Yeah, yeah

### verse

It's the future and I'm braindead

Yeah, I'm destitute, yeah, I feel no roots anymore, anymore

Take another picture (Picture)

Show 'em what you're doing (Doing)

And how we built a lighthouse

Out of all these godforsaken ruins

We know it's coming

None of this can live

The world will recover

Once you put us in the past, yeah

### chorus

All this time I thought you were a leader

It turns out you only a deleter

Tell your friends that you're okay

You're never gonna see them anyway

All this time I thought you were a leader

It turns out you're only a deleter

No, no, no, no

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na no

No, no

Yeah, yeah

### bridge

I don't know

Where to go

Bring the pain

Bring the pain, my brain's dead

I just know, I know you gonna let me out

So bring the pain

Nothing really matters anymore my baby

### chorus

All this time we're burning with the fever

It turn out I've always been a healer

No, no, no, no

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na no

All this time I thought you were a leader

It turns out you only a deleter

No, no, no, no

Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na no

No, no

Yeah, yeah
