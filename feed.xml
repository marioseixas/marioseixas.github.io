<h1 id="spaced-inbox-documentation">Spaced Inbox Documentation</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p>This system provides spaced repetition for your notes written in plain text files, using a simple command-line interface and your favorite text editor. It aims to surface the most relevant and “exciting” notes at optimal intervals for long-term retention, while providing flexibility and control over your review process.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>1. Note Format</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Write your notes in a plain text file (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notes.txt</code>).</li>
  <li><strong>New Note Delimiters:</strong> Two blank lines, or a line containing at least three equals signs (and nothing else) like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">======</code>, signifies the start of a new note.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Defining Inbox Files</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inbox_files.txt</code>:</strong> Create a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inbox_files.txt</code> to tell the script where your notes are located.</li>
  <li><strong>Format:</strong> Each line should follow this structure: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;short name&gt;&lt;tab&gt;&lt;file path&gt;</code>.
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Example:</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">personal_notes /path/to/my/notes.txt</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;short name&gt;</code>: A user-defined identifier for your inbox file, used by the script to distinguish between different inbox sources.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Initializing and Updating the Database</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Initialization:</strong> Running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script.py</code> for the first time creates a SQLite database (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data.db</code>) and imports your notes into it to manage the review schedule.</li>
  <li><strong>Subsequent Runs:</strong>  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script.py</code> performs the following actions on each subsequent execution:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Import new notes:</strong> Detects and adds new notes from your inbox files that haven’t been imported previously.</li>
      <li><strong>Update note locations:</strong> If you’ve edited your inbox file and moved notes around (e.g., by adding or deleting lines), the script updates the corresponding line numbers in the database to ensure accurate navigation during review.</li>
      <li><strong>Handle soft-deletions:</strong> If you remove a note from an inbox file, the script detects its absence and marks it as “soft-deleted” in the database. This prevents the deleted note from appearing in future reviews unless you add it back to the inbox file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Daily Review Process</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Start a Review Session:</strong> Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script.py</code> to initiate a review session. The script will analyze your notes based on due dates, note states, and overdueness to select the most appropriate note for review.</li>
  <li><strong>Note Display:</strong> The script displays the beginning of the selected note along with its corresponding line numbers within the inbox file. This allows you to easily locate the note in your text editor.</li>
  <li><strong>Review in Editor:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Open your preferred text editor.</li>
      <li>Navigate to the indicated line numbers to find the full note content.</li>
      <li>Review the note, make edits if necessary, or delete the note entirely from the inbox file if you no longer need it (this will trigger a soft-deletion on the next <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script.py</code> run).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Record Your Response (in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script.py</code>’s prompt)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[e]xciting</code>:</strong> Use this command if the note is particularly valuable, stimulating, or if you want to ensure you review it more frequently, even if it’s not the most overdue. <em>The script prioritizes “exciting” notes for selection, especially when they are overdue. The more overdue they get, the more likely they are to be chosen.</em></li>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[i]nteresting</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[y]eah</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[l]ol</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[m]eh</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[c]ringe</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[t]axing</code>:</strong> These commands represent varying degrees of positive or neutral feedback. They trigger the standard spaced repetition interval increase according to the SM2 algorithm, but <em>they don’t influence the note’s priority in the selection process beyond its regular due date</em>. The note state is recorded, which could potentially be used for refined note selection logic in future versions.</li>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">again</code>:</strong>  If you failed to recall the note’s content effectively, use this command. The review interval will be shortened (multiplied by 0.9), giving you another chance to learn it sooner. <em>The note state remains unchanged as an “again” response is considered a failure to recall, preventing a proper judgment of its emotional impact.</em></li>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[r]eroll</code>:</strong> If you want to skip the currently displayed note without reviewing it, use this command to request a different note.</li>
      <li><strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[q]uit</code>:</strong>  When you’re finished with your review session, use this command to exit the script.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5. Spacing Algorithm</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Simplified SM2:</strong> The core of the scheduling algorithm is a simplified version of the <a href="https://gist.github.com/riceissa/1ead1b9881ffbb48793565ce69d7dbdd">Anki/SM2</a> algorithm, widely recognized for its effectiveness in spaced repetition learning.</li>
  <li><strong>Initial Interval:</strong>  The default starting interval for new notes is 50 days.</li>
  <li><strong>Subsequent Intervals:</strong>  Future review intervals are dynamically calculated based on your review responses (using the ease factor) and the SM2 algorithm. Specifically, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">good_interval</code> function calculates the new interval by multiplying the current interval by the ease factor (which is always 300 in this implementation) and dividing by 100.</li>
  <li><strong>Note Prioritization (Not just due-date based):</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Exciting” notes:</strong> Notes marked as “exciting” are highly prioritized for review, especially when they become overdue.  The more overdue an exciting note is, the more likely it is to be selected for review. This is achieved through a weighted probability selection process in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_exciting_note</code> function, where the weight is proportional to the square of the number of days the note is overdue.</li>
      <li><strong>Newly created notes:</strong> To reinforce initial learning, newly created notes that have not yet been reviewed receive a probability boost for selection during the 50-100 day period after their creation. This ensures you encounter new notes relatively soon after adding them. This is implemented in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_recent_unreviewed_note</code> function.</li>
      <li><strong>Regular reviewed notes:</strong> For notes that have been reviewed at least once (and are not marked as “exciting”), the script uses a weighted probability based on overdueness.  The more overdue a note is, the higher the chance it will be selected for review. This helps ensure you don’t completely neglect notes even if you skip reviews for a period of time. This is implemented in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get_all_other_note</code> function, similar to how “exciting” notes are prioritized.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ease Factor:</strong> The ease factor, a measure of how easily you recall a note, starts at 300% and remains constant throughout the note’s lifecycle in this implementation.</li>
  <li><strong>“Again” Interval Adjustment:</strong> When a note is marked as “again”, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">again_interval</code> function is used to calculate the new interval, which is simply the current interval multiplied by 0.9.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Use your preferred text editor and any plain text format or markup language you like for your notes.</li>
  <li><strong>Control:</strong> You decide when and how many notes to review each day – there are no strict daily review quotas.</li>
  <li><strong>Intelligent Note Selection:</strong> The script’s note prioritization logic helps you focus on the most relevant and “exciting” notes, making your review sessions more efficient and engaging.</li>
  <li><strong>Editor Integration:</strong>  Seamlessly use your text editor of choice to review and edit notes.  (The optional <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--external-program emacs</code> flag provides even deeper integration with Emacs, allowing automatic navigation to the selected note).</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Destructive:</strong> The script only reads from your inbox files and does not modify them in any way. Your notes remain entirely under your control.</li>

<p>Many Android devices use the RockChip soc these days. I have some using the ARM7 rk3066 dual core. I love it. It is fast but it must come with mali400 gpu. On this page I will try to explain how to customize these devices. Also some tools to do just that are added as downloads to the bottom of this page. I don’t use ClockWorkMod recovery much. All can be done with adb and some unix commands.</p>

<p>I use adb on this page. But adb sometimes doesn’t recognize newer devices. You can help it by creating a <strong>.android</strong> folder in your windows profile folder. Put <strong>adb_usb.ini</strong> in there with the USB VID of your device. RockChip has Vendor ID <strong>0x2207</strong>. See adb download below.</p>

<p>You device needs to be rooted (but most are from the factory).</p>

<p><strong>Backup Backup Backup</strong></p>

<p>The first thing you do before anything is create a proper backup of your new device. Just common sense.</p>

<p>Creating a backup of your device is very simple. You need an sdcard (or use internal /sdcard partition). From the Short Overview page we now know that Android roms are stored in mtd NAND partitions. So we need to get them to the PC.</p>

<p>After turning on your device manage to get an ADB connection working to your PC and follow these instructions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>adb shell</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>su (if not pre-rooted)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>stop</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>cat /proc/mtd</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>copy and paste the content of the output to a text file on your pc</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>mtd0: 00400000 00004000 “misc”</p>

<p>mtd1: 00800000 00004000 “kernel”</p>

<p>mtd2: 01000000 00004000 “boot”</p>

<p>mtd3: 01000000 00004000 “recovery”</p>

<p>mtd4: 18000000 00004000 “backup”</p>

<p>mtd5: 08000000 00004000 “cache”</p>

<p>mtd6: 20000000 00004000 “userdata”</p>

<p>mtd7: 00400000 00004000 “kpanic”</p>

<p>mtd8: 20000000 00004000 “system”</p>

<p>mtd9: 16bc00000 00004000 “user”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>cat /dev/mtd/mtd0 &gt; /sdcard/mtd0_misc.img</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>cat /dev/mtd/mtd1 &gt; /sdcard/mtd1_kernel.img</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>… do that for all mtd’s</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>exit</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> “user” is your internal /sdcard partition which size could be up to 12 Gb !!! Do not backup that one, this is the user installed packages and settings :)</p>

<p>Now back on your PC you need to copy them img’s to the PC with adb. Create a folder on your pc and use:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>adb pull /sdcard/mtd0_misc.img</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>adb pull /sdcard/mtd1_kernel.img</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>… do that for all mtd’s</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For tablet you can also use ClockWorkMod Recovery to do it. I use CWMRecovery_RK3060_5.5.0.4 and flash it using flashtool (only flash recovery!)</p>

<p>Even easier is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.h3r3t1c.onnandbup"></a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.h3r3t1c.onnandbup">NanDroid Backup</a>. You can install it from the PlayStore and perform a MTD backup on a live device. Choose CWM format.</p>

<p>Now you are safe as you can be and you can start changing some things on your device.</p>

<p><strong>Restoring</strong></p>

<p>This shows how to restore your device or flash it with other mtd partitions. There are tools for official RockChip roms. I will attach them below. But on this page I do not use them.</p>

<p>I will show how to restore mtd partitions with unix binary called <strong>flash_image</strong> on a running device. After that I will show how to do it on a dead device using the fastboot method. Fastboot is a low level Android device state which allows you to write mtd nand partitions too. The official RockChip flasher uses that Android device state too.</p>

<p><strong>With adb</strong></p>

<p>You need flash_image from below. And you need your original mtd images created earlier or other mtd images you want to try. Put your device in adb mode first.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>adb push flash_image /sdcard</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>adb push mtd0_misc.img /sdcard/mtd0_misc.img</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>adb push mtd1_kernel.img /sdcard/mtd1_kernel.img</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>… do that for all mtd’s</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>adb shell</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>su (if not pre-rooted)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>stop</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>busybox cp /sdcard/flash_image /dev</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>cd /dev</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>chmod 777 fl*</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>./flash_image misc /sdcard/mtd0_misc.img</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>./flash_image kernel /sdcard/mtd1_kernel.img</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>… do that for all mtd’s</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>cd /data/dalvik-cache</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>rm *</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>sync</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>reboot</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first thing after the reboot is to do a factory reset to wipe the data partition. You will loose all user installed apps and data.</p>

<p><strong>With fastboot</strong></p>

<p>When your device is “bricked” you will not be able to get a proper adb connection. There is an escape: <strong>fastboot</strong>. How to enter fastboot on power up is different on every device. But you need to push and hold a button during boot or push and hold a paperclip in the hole. If in fastboot mode you will see a RK30SDK or similar device in your Windows hardware tree. It requires other USB drivers then regular adb. You can get it from the RockChipBatchTool below.</p>

<p>Fastboot is a <strong>Windows utility</strong>. All commands are done from the pc and are similar to that of the unix flash_image tool described earlier.</p>

<p>example: fastboot flash system mtd8_system.img</p>

<p><strong>Wendal.img: Unpack the firmare image (Rockchip_TOOLS)</strong></p>

<p>The Rockchip firmware image is packed as one img file containing these partitions (example RK3229 firmware):</p>

<p>boot.img</p>

<p>kernel.img</p>

<p>misc.img</p>

<p>recovery.img</p>

<p>resource.img</p>

<p>system.img</p>

<p>trust.img</p>

<p>uboot.img</p>

<p>You can Pack/Unpack it with the RK3066_IMG_Mod_Tool.zip you can download <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fronniehd%2Fandroid.projects.ec%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2FMK808%2FRockchip_TOOLS&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw3M2BDJvvk30-gBHBPUPBg2"></a> <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fronniehd%2Fandroid.projects.ec%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2FMK808%2FRockchip_TOOLS&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw3M2BDJvvk30-gBHBPUPBg2">here</a>.</p>

<p>Put your image in the Mod Tool folder and rename it to <strong>wendal.img</strong></p>

<p>Run the Runme.bat file to Unpack or Pack it. It will be unpacked in the <strong>temp\Image</strong> folder.</p>

<p><strong>Unpack the system.img</strong></p>

<p>You can unpack system.img with <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.xda-developers.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D1921399&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pXTRtpPu148sy-dHJFvOH"></a> <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fforum.xda-developers.com%2Fshowthread.php%3Ft%3D1921399&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw0pXTRtpPu148sy-dHJFvOH">EXT4 Unpacker</a> (or 7-zip now).</p>

<p><strong>System Mods</strong></p>

<p>You might want to change some things on your device’s system partition. Add some things to your build.prop ( better put them in your own /system/default.prop) or remove/add/update some apk’s.</p>

<p>The /system partition is readonly by default. Goto adb shell and mount the partition read-write: <strong>mount -o remount,rw /system</strong></p>

<p>Some interesting read from Finless <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freaktab.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F287-RockChip-ROM-Building-Tips-and-Tricks-by-Finless&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw1PXsFNV1IynPdVXFxKAg-u"></a> <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freaktab.com%2Fshowthread.php%3F287-RockChip-ROM-Building-Tips-and-Tricks-by-Finless&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw1PXsFNV1IynPdVXFxKAg-u">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Deep Sleep</strong></p>

<p>On the RK3066 tablets it is common that Deep Sleep system state is not happening. This is because of the ril daemon and a process that provides 3G USB dongle support. If you don’t use the 3G USB dongle you are better of with Deep Sleep. In standy your tablet battery last much longer.</p>

<p>The easiest way to kill this problem is to kill the rild process. This process starts as a service from the /init.rc file that belongs to the kernel.</p>

<p>service ril-daemon /system/bin/rild</p>

<p>class main</p>

<p>socket rild stream 660 root radio</p>

<p>socket rild-debug stream 660 radio system</p>

<p>user root</p>

<p>group radio cache inet misc audio sdcard_r sdcard_rw log</p>

<p>In a shell you can use this command to stop it each time after a reboot: <strong>stop ril-daemon</strong></p>

<p>Take a close look at that /init.rc file. You will see that /system/etc/install-recovery.sh is called there like this:</p>

<p>service flash_recovery /system/etc/install-recovery.sh</p>

<p>class main</p>

<p>oneshot</p>

<p>Now we can create a shell script <strong>/system/etc/install-recovery.sh</strong> that executes stop ril-daemon</p>

<p>#!/system/bin/sh</p>

<p>stop ril-daemon</p>

<p>Of course you can put into the install-recovery script what you want. Most setprop or sysctl commands or even use it for a semi init.d mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Changing Wifi and BT drivers</strong></p>

<p>Leave alone all other mtd’s and only concentrate on /system. There are kernels that are in the boot.img but there are also devices that have a small boot.img and the kernel.img is used. In the kernel there is the low level driver for the hardware such as bluetooth, wifi and infrared remote control.</p>

<p>But the Android drivers are loaded by modules or libraries in the /system partition.</p>

<p>Check with dmesg command which hardware you have before you change the system.img. For the wifi chip you can also</p>

<p><strong>cat /sys/class/rkwifi/chip</strong> (like MT5931)</p>

<p>For changing the Wifi you need to replace or add with that from your original ROM</p>

<p>/system/lib/<strong>libhardware_legacy.so</strong> (loads proper driver module)</p>

<p>/system/lib/modules/xxxxx.ko (use <strong>lsmod</strong> to find the proper one that is loaded, in case of MT5931 <strong>wlan.ko</strong> is loaded )</p>

<p>/system/etc/firmware/yyyyy (where yyyyy is the file needed for your specific hardware loaded by xxxxx.ko, wlan.ko loads <strong>WIFI_RAM_CODE</strong> )</p>

<p>/system/bin/<strong>netd</strong></p>

<p>/system/bin/<strong>wpa_supplicant</strong></p>

<p>For changing Bluetooth you need to replace or add with that of your original ROM</p>

<p>/system/lib/<strong>libbluedroid.so</strong></p>

<p>/system/lib/<strong>libbluetooth_mtk.so</strong> (or other for specific hardware, this one it for MT6622 )</p>

<p>/system/bin/<strong>hciattach</strong></p>

<p>Of course you need to set the proper owner and permissions.</p>

<p>In /system/build.prop you sometimes find these lines to activate the options in the Android Settings app:</p>

<p>ro.version.radiocontrols=1</p>

<p>ro.version.bluetooth=1</p>

<p>ro.version.ethernet=1</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>You find them by extracting the classes.dex from the Settings.apk file and do a: strings classes.dex</td>
      <td>find “ro.” (strings is sysinternals windows util)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Enable multitouch rotate and tilt (jazzhand) on tablet</strong></p>

<p>On some Rockchip tablets you can only use multitouch zoom, not rotate or tilt. There is an easy fix on your rooted tablet.</p>

<p>Edit the /etc/permissions/android.hardware.touchscreen.multitouch file to read like this and write it back to /etc/permissions folder.</p>

<permissions>

<feature name="android.hardware.faketouch" />

<feature name="android.hardware.touchscreen" />

<feature name="android.hardware.touchscreen.multitouch" />

**<feature name="android.hardware.touchscreen.multitouch.distinct" />**

**<feature name="android.hardware.touchscreen.multitouch.jazzhand" />**

  <li><strong>Tendinitis</strong>: Inflammation of the tendons, which can cause pain and stiffness. However, tendinitis typically affects specific areas rather than the entire arm.</li>
  <li><strong>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome</strong>: Compression of the median nerve in the wrist, leading to pain, numbness, and tingling in the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers. This can sometimes extend up the arm.</li>
  <li><strong>Cubital Tunnel Syndrome</strong>: Compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow, causing pain and tingling in the ring and pinky fingers, which can extend up the forearm.</li>
  <li><strong>Radial Tunnel Syndrome</strong>: Compression of the radial nerve, which can cause pain from the elbow to the hand, often mistaken for tennis elbow.</li>
  <li><strong>Thoracic Outlet Syndrome</strong>: Compression of nerves or blood vessels between the collarbone and the first rib, leading to pain and numbness in the arm and hand.</li>
  <li><strong>Cervical Radiculopathy</strong>: Nerve compression in the neck, which can cause pain, numbness, and weakness radiating down the arm.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="symptoms-to-watch-for">Symptoms to Watch For</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pain</strong>: Along the entire arm, especially when using the mouse or cellphone.</li>
  <li><strong>Stiffness</strong>: In the thumb and other parts of the arm.</li>
  <li><strong>Shocks</strong>: Sudden, sharp pain or tingling sensations.</li>
  <li><strong>Tremors</strong>: Involuntary movements, particularly in the thumb.</li>
  <li><strong>Numbness or Tingling</strong>: In the fingers or arm.</li>
  <li><strong>Weakness</strong>: Difficulty in gripping or lifting objects.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="immediate-steps">Immediate Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Rest and Avoid Aggravating Activities</strong>: Limit the use of the mouse and cellphone.</li>
  <li><strong>Ergonomic Adjustments</strong>: Use ergonomic tools to reduce strain.</li>
  <li><strong>Ice and Compression</strong>: Apply ice packs and use compression sleeves.</li>
  <li><strong>Anti-inflammatory Medications</strong>: Over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="when-to-see-a-doctor">When to See a Doctor</h2>

<p>Given the complexity and severity of your symptoms, it is crucial to consult a healthcare professional for a thorough evaluation. They may recommend:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Physical Examination</strong>: To assess the range of motion, strength, and areas of tenderness.</li>
  <li><strong>Imaging Studies</strong>: X-rays, MRI, or ultrasound to visualize the affected areas.</li>
  <li><strong>Nerve Conduction Studies</strong>: To evaluate nerve function and identify any compression or damage.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="possible-treatments">Possible Treatments</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Physical Therapy</strong>: Tailored exercises and stretches to improve flexibility and strength.</li>
  <li><strong>Medications</strong>: Anti-inflammatory drugs, pain relievers, or corticosteroid injections.</li>
  <li><strong>Ergonomic Adjustments</strong>: Modifications to your workspace and daily activities.</li>
  <li><strong>Surgery</strong>: In severe cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to relieve nerve compression.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weight-lifting-program-for-tendinitis-recovery">Weight Lifting Program for Tendinitis Recovery</h2>

<p>To develop a daily weight lifting program for tendinitis recovery, it is essential to understand the unique characteristics and recovery needs of tendons compared to muscles. Here is a structured program based on the FITT Principle (Frequency, Intensity, Type, Time):</p>

<h3 id="frequency">Frequency</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Perform tendon exercises 2 times a day, separated by at least 6 hours, for 3-4 days per week.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="intensity">Intensity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use a heavy weight that allows you to complete just 8-15 repetitions per set (3 sets of 8-15 reps).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="type">Type</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Execute the exercises at a slow tempo, taking 3-4 seconds for both the upward and downward movements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Limit the tendon exercises to 5-10 minutes with short rest periods of 20-30 seconds between sets.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="example-exercises">Example Exercises</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>ISO File</strong>: Ensure you have downloaded the Windows ISO file you want to use.</li>
  <li><strong>USB Drive</strong>: Insert a USB drive into your computer. Confirm that it has sufficient space for the ISO file and back up any important data, as this process will erase the USB drive.</li>
  <li><strong>Terminal Access</strong>: You need access to a terminal or command line interface.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h3>

<h4 id="step-1-identify-the-usb-drive">Step 1: Identify the USB Drive</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Open a terminal.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Run the following command to list all connected drives:</p>

    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>lsblk
</code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>This command displays a list of block devices. Identify your USB drive by its size and name, which will typically be listed as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdb</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdc</code>, etc. Ensure you correctly identify the USB drive to avoid overwriting other drives.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="step-2-unmount-the-usb-drive">Step 2: Unmount the USB Drive</h4>

<p>Before writing to the USB drive, you need to unmount it. Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdX1</code> with the actual partition of your USB drive (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdb1</code>).</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>umount /dev/sdX1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If your USB drive has multiple partitions, you may need to unmount all of them. You can unmount all partitions of the USB drive using:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>umount /dev/sdX<span class="k">*</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="step-3-write-the-iso-to-the-usb-drive">Step 3: Write the ISO to the USB Drive</h4>

<p>Now, you can use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dd</code> command to write the ISO file to the USB drive. Replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/path/to/your.iso</code> with the path to your ISO file and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/dev/sdX</code> with your USB drive (without the partition number).</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo dd </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/path/to/your.iso <span class="nv">of</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/sdX <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>4M <span class="nv">status</span><span class="o">=</span>progress
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if=</code>: Input file (the ISO file).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">of=</code>: Output file (the USB drive).</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bs=4M</code>: Sets the block size to 4 megabytes, which can speed up the process.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status=progress</code>: Displays the progress of the operation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: Ensure that you do not include a partition number (like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sdX1</code>) in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">of=</code> parameter, as writing to a partition instead of the whole drive can lead to an incomplete or non-bootable USB.</p>

<h4 id="step-4-wait-for-the-process-to-complete">Step 4: Wait for the Process to Complete</h4>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dd</code> command will take some time to complete, depending on the size of the ISO and the speed of your USB drive. Once it finishes, you will see a summary of how many bytes were copied.</p>

<h4 id="step-5-sync-and-eject-the-usb-drive">Step 5: Sync and Eject the USB Drive</h4>

<p>After the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dd</code> command completes, it’s a good practice to ensure all data is written to the USB drive before removing it. Run the following command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sync</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This command flushes the file system buffers, ensuring that all data is written to the USB drive.</p>

<p>Now you can safely eject the USB drive:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sudo </span>eject /dev/sdX
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="important-considerations">Important Considerations</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Double-Check Device Names</strong>: Be very careful with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">of=</code> parameter. If you specify the wrong device, you could overwrite important data on your hard drive.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Loss Warning</strong>: This process will erase all data on the specified USB drive. Make sure to back up any important files before proceeding.</li>
  <li><strong>Booting from USB</strong>: After creating the bootable USB drive, you can boot from it by changing the boot order in your BIOS/UEFI settings. You may need to press a specific key (like F2, F12, ESC, or DEL) during startup to access the boot menu.</li>
